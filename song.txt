Stephanie mom, mom Stephanie
The field blooms, and she is turning grey
Sing me a lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dearest words again

.......................................

She would not wake me, she would never 
wake me during a strong storm
She would take two "fig marks"2 from her 
grandmother as if they were bullets3
