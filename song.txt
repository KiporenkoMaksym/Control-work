Stephanie mom, mom Stephanie
The field blooms, and she is turning grey
Sing me a lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dearest words again

She rocked me, she gave me a rhythm and 
maybe my will canâ€™t be taken away because she gave it to me
She probably knew more than Solomon1
I will always come to you, even when the streets are broken

She would not wake me, she would never 
wake me during a strong storm
She would take two "fig marks"2 from her 
grandmother as if they were bullets3
